Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

 The small website i created is a personal career related website, describing my academic effors so far up untill this moment of writing.
It is an overview of academic achievements and awards i have garnered so far in my highschool and firstdegree.
Also i enlisted some personal information to give it a human touch or rather a little bit of intimacy. In short it is a summary of Alozie Chijindu Victor.
